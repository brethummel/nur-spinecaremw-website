Description
======================

This block is primarily a single WYSIWYG field. It should primarily be used for text, but custom HTML can be entered in the code box to handle special scenarios on a site by site basis. Settings include background color, text alignment, and the ability to visually pair with the block above and/or below (i.e. remove padding). Up to three buttons can also be added.
