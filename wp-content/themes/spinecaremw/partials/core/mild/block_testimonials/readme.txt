Description
======================

The Testimonials block is a slider (based off of slick slider) that can be displayed as text only, or as text plus an image. There is no limit to the number of testimonials that can be added, and if only one is present, it acts as a static panel rather than a slider. Settings include background color and whether images should be included or not. If "Quote + Image" is chosen as the style, the image is still optional, so it can appear on some slides and not others.
