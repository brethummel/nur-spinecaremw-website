Description
======================

The Tiles block is able to display as columns, or as cards (tiles). In column form the image type can only be icons, but as cards, the type can be icons or an image. Settings include background color, and whether or not buttons are displayed for each card. If "Include Button" is set to true, a button is required for each tile.

Stats are planned as a future choice for "Image Type."
