Description
======================

This block is in a two-column layout with text (and optional buttons) on one side, and an image, video, or image carousel on the other. Settings include style, background color, whether the image appears on the right or left, text alignment and whether or not to include buttons with the text. Up to two buttons can be added. If the style selected is a video, the video appears as an oEmbed, and plays right in the page.
