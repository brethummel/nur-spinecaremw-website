Overview
======================

Content blocks are organized into three different categories:

1. Mild (Core) Blocks
2. Medium Blocks
3. Spicy Blocks

The SpringBoard theme includes the core functionality for content blocks across all three categories, and stores them inside this partials/core folder. The core functionality can be overridden by copying a content block's entire folder to the partials/custom folder, in which case it will load instead of the core block. This allows for client-specific customization of one or many blocks while leaving the original blocks pristine.

Mild blocks are all standard with every usage of SpringBoard. For Medium and Spicy blocks are not standard and would be empty by default. To add a block of one of those types, simply drag it into the , individual block folders can

_blocks.acf
======================

The role of _blocks.acf is twofold. First, it loads the ACF fieldsets for each content block, from the partials/custom folder if it finds it there, otherwise from the set of blocks in partials/core. Secondly, if it does find a .acf file for a block inside the partials/custom folder, it adds a sass variable with the block's name and sets it to true, and after loading all .acf files, it writes _custom.scss to the partials/custom folder.


======================
_blocks.php
======================

The _blocks.php file's job is to add whatever content blocks it discovers in the ACF content_blocks flexible content block to the page template. It first looks for a content block's .php file in the partials/custom folder, and if it doesn't find it there, it'll pull the file from the core set of blocks.


======================
_blocks.scss
======================

The _blocks.scss file's job is to add a content block's .scss file to be compiled along with the rest of the stylesheet. Because sass can't look to see whether a file exists first, and because the compiler will fail if a non-existent file is loaded, the mechanism for grabbing either the custom block or the core block is a bit different. For each block, it looks to see whether a variable with it's same name is true (meaning a custom block exists for the block) or false, which have been loaded in via partials/custom/_custom.scss. If the variable is true, it loads the .scss file from the partials/custom folder. If not, it loads it from the core.

For Mild and Medium blocks,
